Protec what's inside a bracket a. Length - 1 followed by a space of course okay so I'll let you run this but the top-level call is to reverse the call the array the name of the array whatever it is and the argument is the end is the length of the array if you want to reverse the whole this is just blank lines okay I'll let you run it it does work okay did everybody like that did anybody like that maybe I should be asking that again what's the point here the point is to learn to think recursively in different ways to hey by the way what if I asked you to you know this this interative algorithm that swaps two guys on the outside then moves in then swaps to then moves in its waps to and it stops when the two indices could you manage to do that recursively so the size of the subarray that you recover on is 2 less every time right you're always recurring on and -2 elements and -2 elements in -2 elements so so the supper AZ work on is the whole thing the whole thing - 2 vat - 2 that -2 that might have to those of your recursive calls until you get down to it either an array of linked one ornery of length 0 and that's when the recurrence Bottoms Up exercise right that recursive function I'm in the wrong. Sorry.
