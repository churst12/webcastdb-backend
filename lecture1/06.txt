over that point if k equals 0 first of all if K is bigger than an then we returned zero that's the boundary case here are the that's the out-of-bounds case I guess I should say here is the boundary case if k equals 0 or k equals n that's the face the size of the triangle then we just returned one otherwise if neither one of these are true then it must be that K is strictly between 10 and we get this one of these yeah so I don't really I might have gotten away without this Branch I guess is what I'm trying to say I'll let you decide if it's possible to get away without that branch and rely on that zero I don't think you can because there's got to be a way to hit one at the bottom of the recursion okay so there's the recursive formula and that's what we returned but notice that this function returns in order to do one invocation of the function it requires two refers of invocation not one so boxed race is going to look more complicated let's do a box Trace am I on the wrong page yes hang on
