first call second call so here is reverse array to right here Prince out the reversal of the rightmost and elements in a notice that the arguments to the function are exactly the same as before but now the meaning of the parameter in is different than it is here the meaning of n here was the number of elements counting from the Left End to be reversed the meaning of in here is the number of elements from the right end to be reversed okay so again if and is zero it's an empty array so you don't need to do anything otherwise if n is bigger than 0 first the recursive call so we print the rightmost and -1 elements reversed just subtract 1 from an and then require on that size of a sub problem and then what do we have to do we have to print out the nth element from the right what's the an element from the right a brackets something okay so remember aright indices start at zero the rightmost index is and element starting from the right so a. Length - 1 is the 0z first element from the ride the count left and you're going to end up at length of a minus an does that make sense try it and see by the length of disarray is 4 that's the top-level call that's the size of the full array so for instance how do I identify that number how do I get the length of the arrays for if I take 4 - 3 that's one one is the index of 2 is it not here or the indices 01230 I'm going to switch thank you
