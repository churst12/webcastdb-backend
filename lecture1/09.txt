how did we do this what were the steps first print the nth element from the left so an is a parameter to the function at this level of the recursion and is four at this level and is 3 at this level in is too at this level and is one at this level and is 0 at the top level call and is the length of the array if you want to reverse the whole array so what do you do after you print the inside element from the left in that case you euroker on everything to its left so print the leftmost and -1 elements in reverse order that's what the recursive call accomplishes all right so I really didn't mean to put in here the top-level function reverses the leftmost and elements in the array that it does it by first printing out the rightmost in that Subway reversing everything to the left recursively okay so now that I think I've explained that I'm 5 confused people let's look at the code
