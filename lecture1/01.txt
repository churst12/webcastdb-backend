because they programming is hard good cool thank you okay I'd rather not have them in front of me I'll wrap it up when I'm done I just want one of them there there we go are examples of Persian in is there a spiral search efficient factorial and merge sort factorial binomial coefficient reverse probably kind of oil okay to take a wild guess that that's it take it easy check is anybody hearing this check okay that's about as I'll go one notch higher that's it there we go Sahel get rid of that one okay let's go ahead and begin for a little bit late the first thing I want to draw your attention to is it there have been some changes to the lab schedule know times and place have changed but what has changed is Staffing so starting yesterday as I promised and then today Wednesday well including 8 to 10 a.m. this morning I hope hopefully somebody Avail themselves of that session but also this evening from 6 to 8 two more sessions Thursday and Friday there's also some kind of minimal Staffing for this week at the labs if anybody needs help with especially basic things like logging on submitting an assignment if you're not used to submitting using the submit procedure that we have for this course did anybody go to the 8 session this morning nobody did so she was just there by herself all right okay in the future I do expect to have two people on each of these sessions so there is lots of availability for getting help in the course remember the Tas will also have some independent office hours so they'll be that opportunity for help along with my office hours there were a lot of people at my office hours today but that all had to do with enrollment questions so that reminds me there's an announcement I have to make about enrollment and this is at this is this is directed to anybody who is cross enrolled between my course and Dustin's course Dustin Adams court if anybody takes 12 bo1 with me and isn't let's put it this way if anybody remains enrolled in 12 Mo 1 and 12 BO2 or 12 Mo to in 12 bo1 the other cross enrollment anybody that remains enrolled in that manner is going to get F on both courses nothing that you submit and other course will be accepted as valid work anybody who let that happen is not going to pass either course I know that I'm only talking to a handful of people but those handful of people need to know this that cannot go forward and the governing enrollment is 12-b so who am I as I understand it if you're enrolled in my 12v then drop the other 12 m and you will get a permission code not from me but from somebody to get into 12 M if you are in Dustin's 12b then drop my 12 M and you can start going to that course you don't want to get in that car if you want to be in this course then drop everything and get on my 12m waitlist that's the that's the only Avenue to get into my 12 be okay set understood you got it you got it well let's put it this way may be reluctant to drop 12 my 12v if you're in my 12v and you want to take my 12b but you're not in my 12 and you're in the wrong 12 a.m. drop the wrong whatever it is make sure you just drop you don't remain cross enrolled question here before I go further okay okay so I had a talk with Staff last night and that's the policy that's it we're going to go forward with no also to those who are still trying to get into the course which there are quite a few the most important waitlist to be honest the 12 M wait list is what I told everybody practically who talked to me this morning and office hours get on the 12 M waitlist if you get on the 12v waitlist and you reach the front and you're not in the 12in waitlist you'll just see a bunch of other people going in front of you those are the people on the 12 m waitlist they won't get you anywhere and you got to be on the 12 a.m. waitlist once you get to the front of that line you get into the course somebody will eventually email you a permission code for the other half of the course is that clear and I realize now that I made a mistake you know I should have set up this course so that they're not independent courses right so that I mean they are independent courses but I should have set up the grading so that whatever you get in one course you get in the other course so you can't pass one and not the other because eventually we're going to merge these two courses so that they're just one course which is what they should be this is really a fiction that we have two separate sections I think but I didn't do that so I am not going to change the rules as I as I do find them in the syllabus this is how you will be great and I consider this kind of a contract right does that I'm going to calculate your grade okay well that's about all the business I wanted to discuss is there anything else that's on people's minds before I pick up where we left off last time go ahead in that case you should then to wait list for 12 B is for you you're the kind of person that the 12v wait list is actually for you don't need to take 12in you should be on the 12v waitlist then when you get to the front of the 12v line nobody else will go in front of you you will get in that clear so that thing about cross enrollment that I said that's only directed to people who need both courses if you've already passed one and not the other but that's the complication that I'm propagating by not setting up migrating properly if you pass one but not the other then that earlier comment wasn't directed at you question that is not true I just got through explaining that if you read my syllabus if you read my syllabus you'll see that there's an algorithm here for computing your 12v and there's a different algorithm for computing your 12m grade all I'm saying is in retrospect I wish I had used a different algorithm but I'm not going to change it now does everyone understand what I'm saying now okay any other matters of administrative issue before we pick up where we left off okay where did we leave off while we're talking about recursion recursive functions and recursive algorithms and look at this right in the middle it's typical isn't it something wants to update in the middle of a presentation so we talked about the factorial function and we did a box trace of its operation just to understand recursion and then we talked about another recursive function this is a recursive function of two variables well look at it this way it's the definition of this function cnk is not recursive it's completely combinatorial C&K is the number of K element subsets of an N element set and I did a short example to make sure everybody understands what I mean the number of two elements subsets of a 3 element set for instance is 3 and here they are and these numbers for n equals 3 is just one row of Pascal's triangle but there's a nice rule for generating Pascal's triangle that you all know and it is this Rule and this rule is recursive and it is a well-known method for computing binomial coefficient I wanted to prove this formula so let me go to the document camera and pick up where I left off
