Legacy right and I read this place many many times did a lot of research on a drama Target once at Carnegie Mellon and this is what I think it's about okay. The only thing it's about but this is what I think is one way of approaching it Legacy is Define as the past in harmony with the I'm going to call it that anyway today right so we talk about your Barack Obama's Legacy right he's worried about his legacy is a way of remembering the past that is in harmony with the way that we're living in the present right we see problems with it like with the issue of Confederate statues right this is an example of a failure of Legacy right the past with the present right and of course I told you such a thing of the past is history history in harmony with with in this play that Harmony is very elusive right and because it's this harmonious we have we have monsters Sutter the yellow dog ghost trolley we never shows up cleotha who never shows up everyone else who has died they're all present right they're absent but they're also present early on this convention of microscopy which is seen the day and talking to the dead right scope for someone who actually communicates with the dead to get information okay what I heard something something culture The Good Egg the strong answer something something cold why doesn't she want to play the piano why didn't you want to commune with the Dead yeah write her mom her mom got so deep into it that she couldn't really come out to Hulu and saying about it right yeah we think she's afraid she is afraid what she afraid of what is a ghost represent she's afraid of what she will learn if she confronts the past she's afraid of what what you will learn one of my students in this class was asking me last week about like why am I so scared of this particular monster that I don't know why I'm scared of it I just know that I'm really really scared of it and I said well you probably maybe if we believe the the friends you know you associate that monster with something that happened to you that you was traumatic and you can't actually remember it because whenever you try to remember it all you get is an image of that monster and that's actually your subconscious trying to protect you from a painful memory that you're not ready to deal with and so she said that what I do about it and I said nothing it will become clear when the time is right you know in the meantime when you see the monster that scares you go toward it right when you see things that are strange scary go toward them that's that's the whole point of this class I have one that's the old railroad that's all that's left of it and then this is where I remember where the two track meet they talk about the crossroads always a very important spiritual Place Crossroads dangerous spiritual place that's why in southern lure if you're going to make a deal with the devil you go to the crossroads but I've got another lecture on that later but I think so
