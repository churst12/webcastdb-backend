ballistic you know ceremony whole home but that's happened to me you know I think if you're open sometimes I hear the beautiful Irish songs about going home and mull of kintyre right now even know what the hell that is like all God oh how I miss the mall of kintyre from my barber shop the same bird of bird the well remember how we talked about the fluidity of gender and the in fluidity of other things I think that's what that's stopping me maybe it should I talk about so what we know is about the ghosts in this play is that they travel on the wind right they defied time and space and they see everything and everything is going on all right then I asked this question okay I had this question why isn't Avery's exorcism work right every is the Christian right who comes in and he's like don't worry I will handle this with my maleness and my Christianity going to fix this don't worry power of Christ compels you right doesn't work why doesn't it work yes putter is a part of their family right Sutter is in that piano as much as Bernice's mother is as much as their ancestors were even though he was the slave owner right he's part of their family I got to tell you that what I read was really hoping for was that they were we were going to find out in this play every time I read this I'm still hoping for even though I know it's not possible cuz I read it before that we're going to find out that some of them are descended from Saturday as well so they would have to reconcile with the fact right that's utter is also their family but he is still their family only through the piano right magically because we have this breakdown of time and space you've connected to them so only a member of the family can exercising a lot of people when they read this play the think about the relationship between Sutter and Hamlet's father right and I've also put up nearly headless Nick here because he has a lot in common with both of them all right he was murdered he brings information is fatherly demands to be remembered and like nearly headless Nick he's holding down the top of his head why is he holding down the top of his head leave the cutoff vampire test before they buried when I was in real life vampire or they would exhume people who were vampires they would cut off their heads and put them in there in between their knees and then bury them across the y yes the crossroads is a good place to get lost right but if you don't if your head is not attracted to you attached to your body where we going to say who yes so right so he he remember how he died have Sutter died broken neck right the yellow dog goes push him into a well or he was drunk and he fell into a well right side or possibly right right oh no no no no Reserve like okay is he really a werewolf or is he just crazy right no this is the same thing to you know is it is it a ghost who's doing all these things or they just feel out of their minds because of the the predicament and the answer is it doesn't really matter right it doesn't really matter Isaac on the top of his head if you if your head comes loose from your body you cannot know yourself he wants to be remembered right so he's holding down the memory part was holding it to you can think of it as like he's holding his own form to the material plane if his mind went away he would no longer exist so he's holding down his own head cuz I think it's amazing because when I went in that last scene when who is it goes upstairs boy with us to fight him we never see him but I see him right step 11 I totally see him he's wearing a blue suit he's holding his hand down and did you like you like boom boom boom
