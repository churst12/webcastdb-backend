good idea as a response to the Civil Rights Movement to create African American studies class Robert Wilson wrote a very famous speech that he gave where he said that that was a waste of time it was it would cheapen American education and it wasn't important because it was just a flash-in-the-pan thing anyway establishing his credentials as a racist so so just so you know he was a very very famous theater after he ran the American Repertory Theater at Harvard okay which is a associated with Harvard but also a professional Theatre Company and one year he reluctantly agreed to put on a play by a black author I don't remember what play was it may have been an August Wilson play and as a result of doing that he won a big a big award from the Nea for promoting diverse theater right even if it was for one show and August Wilson said hey you know the Harlem Black Arts Theater put on 100% of it shows every year that are about black people by black people with black actors in it and this grant which was like five million dollars will run our entire company for a year for 5 years whereas this grant for the art will run their air conditioning system for 6 months right so like and so he complained about it and then it got very nasty and they started writing letters back and forth in the dramatist guild cordially and I was a member of The dramatist Guild so every month I would get these and I'll be like oh my God what's happening in so finally they had a town hall on NPR and they all went to New York and they sat down and then we're going to let you know actually argue it out and here is some of the things that Bruce team that this is what Wilson said okay he said why is this in the nights right why is white experience assumed to be Universal and black experience somehow particular right now this is something that since then I mean it's almost twenty years later now we argue about these questions a lot right you know so like we have African American studies right like is that saying like a real studies and then we have African American studies which is not real somehow right Chicano studies Asian studies you can see what my approach to this is which is I pick a topic and then I bring in as many diverse writers on that. Because I can't write so that's I think a wiser way of approaching this but in the 60s that it was it was pretty cool enough to set some side space aside in the campus for this kind of discussion but he said why is white experiences Envy Universal and black experience in my particular why are black artists expected to become Universal by transcending race and moving beyond black themes never is it suggested that play like David Mamet or Terrence McNally are limiting themselves to whiteness the idea that we are trying to escape from the ghetto of black culture is insulting and this was in response we should have set this up by saying yeah or two bruising saying yeah I will admit that that you know August Wilson's work is valuable he's a great playwright because his work transcends race yeah and it's true actually that 90% of of Wilson's audiences white people write was white people who gave him the Pulitzer Prize right it's true most of us audiences white most of the theater audience in America is white okay but does that mean that he's transcending race or does it mean that his writing so good that people actually willing to step outside their comfort zone in order to experience it I don't know I know where it is for me I know that was his response response response to this was he said basically he was like what are you trying to do you think my writing black players are going to advance any kind of social discourse is art doesn't change social consciousness you can imagine how I feel about that about the director of the American Repertory Theater at Harvard saying write expression when I think about fantasy you know if it wasn't for this is I know this sounds ironic right but if it wasn't for Lord of the Rings I would be a 350-pound shut in what are the rings taught me how to relate to people Star Trek or Star Trek but it's like the first one the 61 I was born in 1970 just so you know I'm not like Richard McCain I don't have it today this is the one day I really need it what is there anyway you can imagine how I how I reacted to that right you guys know a little bit about what I think about the relationship of Art and social Consciousness right individuals and individuals but then you got a little dark no pun intended it was like I just saw it and I thought I'm going to go for it and it was a mistake got a little dark because August Wilson said he said look white Theater now that you have finally started to realize that there's a market for black theater in America white theaters now starting to appropriate black theater like art did and got this big Award right and Wilson said something like so what are you saying like that that black people should only write plays about black things and white people showing right place by white things and not with an ink gun we're like what what what what did you just say I'm like pick that radio up and bang it against you said yes black people should write about black experiences in white people should wait about right experiences and never the twain shall meet and when we are performing and when we are engaging with color conscious theater we should stick to her okay and so a lot of us liberals that point would like August Wilson is the leader he is taking us into the new generation that is this wait a minute how do I react I don't know I'm off strip I know but her know what the total drama requires that made right so so an actor got up who and she says that there's a question answered. And she says excuse me mr. Wilson my father's black my mother's white I was raised in a Latino community in New York who do I play He said you have to choose it's right for a long time all the time and I realize that he has chosen right he had a choice and he chose so I can kind of see maybe where he's coming from a little bit you know it doesn't have to be my choice this is why they say if you meet the Buddha on the road kill him you heard that you've never heard that phrase if you meet the Buddha on the road kill him and the reason why you kill the Buddha on the road is because it's not the Buddha that would have came and went man who's gone if you meet a person on the road who says the Buddha that's person is not your friend right so even August Wilson there for now. But when I'm on the road I did not kill him and I did not say you know I did not come out of my reverie let you know what I want to talk to you about the town hall what do you mean I have to choose I didn't say that I just said yes he did he went to Great Lengths about this and you can read all of this to transcripts online if you just type in Wilson boosting the bait it's all there for you okay but it did get down to this question which is the question that I think we are still really struggling with to this very day which is this who has the right to play home for home who has the right to speak for home one of things I noticed about the culture at Santa Cruz is that we have achieved a level of discourse about gender in which we are very accepting I think not maybe not as much as I could be but compared to the national average we are very accepting of the of the notion of gender could be very fluid right that people could move in and out of their gender at will because gender is a social contract like yeah no changing gender would be like if they were started cross-dressing or something right now we're pretty we're pretty Advanced about that not as much as we could be but in our discourse about race we also know that race is a social contract we know this but our discourse about race is pretty fixed isn't it my relationship princess to whiteness is really weird it's really weird I grow up Jewish in Salt Lake City okay so I know a little bit about what it's like to be pulled over for driving in your neighborhood you know or not to be to get a job or to be harassed by police for no reason I know a little bit about that I know a little bit about what that's like but it's very difficult for me to communicate that to people unless you're a captive audience and you're saying that you have to listen what I said you know but you know to what extent are Jewish people white man responsibilities that are connected so we don't really get to move back and forth so much in terms of our race and there are really good reasons for that socially right it's a very important right now just versus race I'm not predicting them I'm merely observing right who has the right to speak for home and who gets to be who gets to occupy that position and under what conditions how do I quit yeah let's do a quiz on canvas and the the code word is
