I love this play August was born 1945 he was raised in poverty by a single mom in Pittsburgh dropped out of school after teacher accused him of plagiarizing a paper on Napoleon he had plagiarized he wrote it as you can see he was a great great thinker right but he was black and he was poor so they figured he must have stolen it and that was an important lesson for him I think the other lesson was that his father was white and have run out on them right so this is part of what forms his his attitude about life as a black person in America he co-founded the black Horizon theater in Pittsburgh and that's when he began to write his template Pittsburgh cycle which is also called the century cycle now one of the signature achievement is that a lot of a lot of playwrights write plays that are thematically link right so like Shakespeare Prince wrote you know a series of plays I think there's about five of them deal with the history of a particular royal family right the plantagenet send the shooters and then wrote like 10 plays that are all basically the same play with minor variations on each of you to see how different ideas to write August Wilson is done something that no other playwright has done which is that he wrote 10 plays which are actually one play it start in the 1800's and it ends in the 21st century and it is a there's one play for every decade of the 20th century but anyway right so so you can and it's all about one family and so some of the characters that are mentioned in this play are actually appear another point in the earlier earlier place so it's called the Pittsburgh cycle and no one has ever done this before this is an astonishing accomplishment I think they're completing now in New York free year-long run when they're doing all of them in order yeah so we were going to do in Pittsburgh I became part of the August Wilson Theatre in Pittsburgh and we were going to do it but they lost all their money and fell apart okay right I said
