I don't know I don't know there is not okay now I want to show you this scene this is from the Hallmark TV production of this and I've got a lot of very famous actors in it who were famous back then and are still famous and this is Jim ever the scene when they're there their they're giving is a boy willing to give him a hard time about his about the time that he spent on the parchment farm right the person from is a labor camp for for prisoner for criminals right and they start singing this song that is the song that they used to sing when they were working on the farm right well this is another one of those examples of step to you know in the in the 12-step program because if you don't see this on stage you have no idea what's happening now this is a TV version of it but I think you can get the idea pretty strongly so what I want you to look for in this send his moments where the past and the present become confused okay moments we're ghosts emerge so keep an eye on it they had Lima Burdock burrs Play I Will it's great in it that wonderful like that is a I to me that is one of the most beautiful moments in 20 Century American Theater right there right could ghosts that right there all over the place and Joker this is this moment is a microcosm of the whole play weirdo Kurt does not want to engage with the ghosts you know why is there once they were fucking prison right it was awful and they sang to express how awful it was right not fun you're the one to go but he eventually he's called by that
