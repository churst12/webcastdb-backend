want to confront the entanglement yeah that makes sense alright so Bernie some boy will your brother and sister right so they act as parallel characters for one another in in in Renaissance playwright and we call this a foil foil so likely are tooth is a foil for Hamlet so you can see what two people in similar situations would do and what happens if they do different things you know you can follow it out right so so boy Willie is a foil for Bernice oh by the way who is the protagonist Bernice not exactly yeah I don't think there's any question right about that right that's truly strong strong protagonist in Ark for her boy really reminds me of Jonathan Harker right so Jonathan Harker we haven't talked about Jonathan Harker yet but he's an idiot right the guy who he works for drinks blood and the guy that he works for lived all by himself in a giant house with no servants and the guy who works for Cooks all the food for him but never eats any of it and the guy who works for Turns Upside Down and climbs head-first down a tower and he's got demon wives and driving records like okay the clients a little weird but there's money to be made here and my position at the firm depends on me pulling this off well so I'm going to be a good little Cog in the Pro neoliberal machine and I am going to ignore the fact that I am in danger of my Supernatural soul and surrounded by monsters he's just like nope nope nope same thing with with boy Willie no ghost is going to stop him from making money he wants revenge and he thinks that the money is Revenge he wants to erase the past and said her with it but he can't Cossetta's a part of the family right now Bernice on the other hand wants to preserve the past in an unblemished way right that she wants to also not acknowledge stutters connection right now August Wilson himself would disagree with this that's right but I I'm going to respectfully disagree with the playwright so this isn't work either so she's Frozen right she can't move she can't she can't leave she can't stay she can't choose Frozen until she plays the piano so her transformation at the end into what ultimately becomes a priestess write a medium right you know what they called mediums mediums because they're in between like you are like a meeting for writing medium is like between past and future between one person and another between now and then right that's what a medium is media for communication so she becomes a medium and what she does is she reconciles the past in the present but she's Summers our families ghost and a spell or possibly integrate to go to Sutter we don't really know which one it is but what I asked if this is like what if what they do is what if what she's doing when she plays the piano when she finally acknowledges that stutter is one of their family she's he is part of their history either way he gets what he wants which is to be remembered right so he's pretty shit but remember what he says when he leaves the house at the end he's like you better you better stay on that piano world to me and Sutter going to come back right yeah just let me ask screwed as a director could you make a choice about that could we like actually see the ghost being either expelled or integrated yes right we can make that choice yeah I think August leaves it open to us right but I don't think August Wilson would like Austin integrate Sutter I think that would be a counter Wilson Choice which we can still make but I think that we need to know that August himself might haunt us if we do okay so this is Alfre Woodard and Charles Esten playing Bernice and boy Willie and is the final scene
