all right okay so it turns out that a very high percentage of you guys the highest ever this year are running papers for the final assignment it's not what I expected usually people want to do the assignments that are collaborative or or that are they think they're going to be less work that wrong that a performance or a visual research project is left work because you're collaborating not right but I'm I'm delighted that someone if you guys are working papers so in terms of that you will find in the syllabus this rubric to see this through brick what you can tell looks like a t square right so I wrote this rubric this is this is basically a breakdown of what we are expecting from your papers okay so if you're looking for like if you want to know how we grade papers right there everything's right there down this side are the categories that we grade you on okay so they are Theory evidence organization and Clarity is this level we call this sophisticated this describe what your paper is like right so you want it say like is my paper and a paper to self these questions right here cuz that's what we're going to be asking Abby paper is this one that middle one I see paper is this one it's really simple okay and you get graded across four different categories so a d paper is one that is woefully incomplete in any one of the four areas and an F paper at the very bottom it says if this is how you get a nap in this class if your paper is dishonest right that is if you plagiarize it or bought it from a service or at your work in some way that's enough if it does not complete the assignment prompt that's enough if it is incomprehensible because you didn't bother to learn grammar at some point or spelling and it's incomprehensible that's sorry like I know English sucks English is a very very perverse and difficult language I get that but this is how we teach the class this is now the time for you to know that stuff or if it just has really really serious errors in the evidence or the theory okay so if for instance you say that Freud invented the Oldsmobile I'm going to be like no that was funny am I having you guys don't know what an Oldsmobile is that's what year is it what year is it right now 2018 it worked I'm a genius wait who's the president who's the president Trump I totally forgot what I was talking about if you said that Sigmund Freud invented the iPhone relatability the gears of my time machine gets stuck sometimes it is an Oldsmobile now they go out when you funny but what I'm getting Spencer's young and relatable I'm old-fashioned oil Semi illyrius yeah all right there is a there is a fourth category over here which is masterful okay this is something for you to shoot for I don't expect you to be masterful this is not an a paper this is a paper where I say why are you a student we should just give you your degree now and you should start publishing we could go out there something maybe okay so you should strive towards masterful but I don't expect you to be masterful I mean seriously like I told my kids today if you actually went into an Egyptian tomb in the course of doing the research for this paper and found something that no one else has ever found and it changed the way that we look at mummies you can have your ex but you know I don't know that that's going to happen okay now for those of you who are collaborating on projects this is a theater class theater is fundamentally collaborative collaboration is a skill that you will use in any aspect of your life unless you are a novelist in almost every other field you are going to have to collaborate at some point with other people so collaboration is a very very good skill when Silicon Valley complains to the University of California Santa Cruz about why we're not putting together a students who can do the kind of work that they want us to do they complain about two things they say the students who graduate from your engineering and computer science programs are not good at collaboration and they're not good at creativity why don't you teach those things and I'm like that's what we teach an Arts I know you know your schedule but here you are and here's a chance for you to do but I want to stress it says in the syllabus I'm not exactly sure where but it says that the definition of a royal ass-whole is one person who makes other people in their group do the work for them please do not be that asshole I use a soul because it's a gender-neutral term everybody's got one but nipples do I guess who doesn't have to say thank you it's not an insult yeah don't don't be that nipple no nose people up there like dear Chancellor Blumenthal he said nipple today any questions on your final stuff yes I see when they were here yes yeah that your ta has set those dates yes that is due that is due now yes in your section or whatever yeah right what's the that's a that's a t a question yes I will put up I'm remiss on putting up the Presley's open them up pinky swear yes I pinky swear when when you're doing your presentation you talk a little bit about the production is your question I think that you need to tell your your classmates what they need to know to understand what you're doing right so you can talk about you think what we're trying to do here is you know create an adaptation that reflects our concerns and some interesting way or whatever it is right if you don't think you need that if you think that your performance contains all of that then just just in the performance yeah okay so the visual research project you are going to write something that accompanies that right and so when you are presenting the visual research you're basically summarizing what you said in that in that document okay so ideally like every three of you guys may be working on one three of y'all guys is the gender term I was working on that you people what are you you dude let's say there's three of the dudes working on that three of you little monsters are working on are working on what's another dimension don't go in there okay there's going to be three of y'all who y'all are working on this and one of you will talk about the first incarnation of the monster one the second one within the overall Arc right at the end of the day what we're really looking for is how has the interpretation of the monster changed over time and why what aspects of the society are you responding to so what you're saying Alyssa got hit them but the poster board is mostly your visual research so so if you got writing you can stick it you can mail it to the like fluid tape it maybe I don't know okay yes MLA please MLA citation style and everything everybody but you're not going to we're not going to kill you if you get a few things wrong in the MLA citation Style Just so you back shut up yeah not going to hurt you this on that whatever you want to use just not that one by Mary Jane McCormack with fucking sucks and I don't know why anybody would no no toll yeah absolutely free the guys can work together and yes one document all three of you are contributing to that thanks for that clarification right yeah cuz I swear it's okay if you guys to work together and use each other's writing right and this one is fine because your coat the three of you or co-authoring one document right and then doing all this research okay I'm glad you asked that question. Clarifications important yeah I would like everything that you looked at on their right I mean generally speaking if you're doing research you should put in your bibliography everything that you looked at right even if you didn't use it that's fine because that helps the reader now are you going to get knocked down for not putting extra stuff in there no you won't on the other hand I mean all of the things being equal it will make any difference but like maybe if your week in another area get out Spencer is a sucker for a good bibliography I have seen this guy walk in the rain for a good bibliography so he might be like well are they arguing with little weed with a bibliography so full of it right scintillating yeah if you're if you're doing any of the larger things I want a production history for each thing that you're doing now of course that means that sometimes you're not doing plays right so obviously a production issues design for a play it can work though for a movie or even a video game right so for a video game I mean everybody who worked on the video game because thousands of people working a video game so you can just put like the big names like if you're doing Skyrim there's some famous actor right and so you and then you can say like this is who this is this is the team that load it right are the team that directed so that's fine I don't actually I don't do a lot of research and video game so I don't know what the citation protocols for video games are but basically like you know you can buy me a games put out that's that's fine but then do the rest of it look at the reviews right I try to find good reviews try not to find like you know my little brother's blog where he's like yeah I play this game is suck try to find IGN or again sure if you want a pure I'll third grade version Thomas worship baby reading okay that's one opinion I would like you I would like to know please. I know this can get very bloody among Gamers people take this very seriously I would like you to I would like you to use a review from a from a publication that can be an online publication but that has some reputation right so iOS 9 io9 art gamer.com what informer game informer yes I know that one Game Informer yeah okay that makes sense I need to talk about the awards that they want to cuz they give away Video Game Awards like candy so yes yeah if you're using if using a something that I if using a class lecture as a source or or one of my prezzies you can just put class lecture why did you put Tremors Michael M Class lecture if you can remember the date that's great and then and if it's a Prezi you can just put the title of the president which is like necro drama or Fangs for the Memories or somewhere. next week the one on vampires is called the hemosexual agenda they got it I didn't get that but yet the question was for the performance history written written in-text citations in text citations are fine yes or no matter as long as I don't really care as long as we can actually trace it back so that if I am reading your paper I have a question about where it came from I can see exactly how I see what you got this okay cool rights Playskool yeah this is this is actually one of my favorite place that I've ever read August Wilson when someone I just want to tell you really quickly he's someone who had a profound impact on my life personally the first play that I ever saw that was not in Utah was was the first touring production of his play ma rainey's black bottom and it's a it's a beautiful play very powerful watch a great music in it and it was the first time that I realized that a play could be about something other than like yes and racism brothers or Sunday in the park with George or something else is fun right that better play could actually have meat to it that a play could actually have something important to say and I was 14 and I fell madly in love with this and then I had the great great honor of being able to tell August Wilson that himself and he was a very very kind man who died in 2005 and I was I was like a playwright living in Seattle at the time that I met him in 1999 I think and I was working for a theater or Theatre Company their act and that's if you haven't left yet she from San Francisco to and I have been given permission to do a staged reading of one of my place and I had a director and I have a cast so cool and we had to the theater and then all the sudden one day a month before we're going to do this the doctor comes to me and says August Wilson says he wants to do a staged reading of his brand new play King Hedley II in our space so you're at didn't say I'm sorry Caitlin said you're out and I was like oh shit I really want to go to that but I think I'm committed to go to my appointment and so we wind up doing it in the kitchen we had like six people in the audience and I'm fiercely taking notes and then I hear whispering in the back of my turn around and there's August Wilson watching my state reading and I right he was one of his probably the most famous American playwright of his day as I walked up to him and I was like I think I said something like where is black bottom shoes and he said he said something to me that I will never forget you said they told me I just placed you I'm really sorry scrape up the dust that falls off your shoes so because of that very hurt my new connection that I had with August Wilson I actually wound up getting interviewed on NPR about him when he died I know right I got a thousands and thousands of people in America who could have but anyway wbr WBUR Boston on point remembering August Wilson 2005 you can hear me make a fool of myself on National radio so I love this play I Love August
